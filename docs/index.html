      <h1>What is a 1x Engineer?</h1>
      <p>You might have already heard of a <a href="http://10x.engineer/">10x engineer</a>. Probably too often, actually. If there's such a thing as a 10x
        engineer, surely there must be a 1x engineer, too?</p>
      <p>Of course there is! Let's dig into a non-exhaustive list of what qualities make up a 1x engineer.</p>
